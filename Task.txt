As the team's Technical Manager, I'm excited to assign you a key project aimed at leveraging the power of AI to enhance document retrieval and querying capabilities. Your mission is to develop a proof-of-concept Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application written in Python that utilizes the Langchain and OpenAI API to efficiently search and extract information from a collection of PDF documents.

You will begin by setting up an environment to handle PDF document parsing, followed by text extraction and text splitting. From there, you will generate embeddings and use a vector store to create a document indexing system. The key part of the project will involve implementing a question-answering system using a combination of Langchain's chains and OpenAI's ChatGPT model to respond to queries about the document content.
