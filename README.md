# RAG-Document-Query
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Document Query using Langchain &amp; OpenAI API 

Also, with Llama 3.1 8b


You are a developer at a large corporate firm with an extensive archive of PDF documents, from technical specifications to project reports, stored over many years. The current method of retrieving specific information from these documents is inefficient and time-consuming, requiring manual search through countless files. As an initiative to enhance productivity and document management, your team has been tasked with developing an AI-powered document querying system utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. The goal is to implement a question-answering system capable of interpreting and responding to complex queries about document contents using OpenAI’s GPT model via Langchain’s tools. The deliverable will be a prototype ready for initial review and testing, with adjustments and enhancements planned based on initial feedback.


# Objectives:
Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) susing Langchain
Create a RAG retrieval chain
Extract text from PDF file
Generate text embeddings
Store embeddings in a vector store

# Requirement:
Basic Python programming skills
Good understanding of LangChain (v0.2)

# What you'll learn:
LangChain v0.2
LangChain Retrievers
LangChain Chains
Text splitters
Vector stores
FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
Embedding models

# Task
You will begin by setting up an environment to handle PDF document parsing, followed by text extraction and text splitting. From there, you will generate embeddings and use a vector store to create a document indexing system. The key part of the project will involve implementing a question-answering system using a combination of Langchain's chains and OpenAI's ChatGPT model to respond to queries about the document content.
